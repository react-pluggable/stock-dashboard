# Stock-Dashboard

## Description

A demo to showcase the functionality of [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [react-pluggable](https://react-pluggable.github.io/). We have tried to build a stock monitoring app that showcases data in graph format. `react-pluggable` allows you to add features in a pluggable way.

## How to use

You can select a stock to see its data in the selected chart format. You can also use search to filter out the preferred stock.

## Role of react-pluggable

We have used `react-pluggable` to inject different types of graphs in run-time. To add a new type a graph, a person can simply add a new plugin and the graph will automatically come as an option. The application graciously shows the ease of use of the plugin and how it can be injected anywhere inside the react application to render or to just install a functionality.
